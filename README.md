# 🌽 Automated Stand Count for Corn Plants

This repository contains my final thesis project for the **Bachelor’s Degree in Data Science** at the **Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires (ITBA)**, completed during the first semester of 2024.

The objective was to design a machine learning solution to **automate the stand count (plant counting) process in corn fields** using drone imagery and deep learning models.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This work focuses on applying computer vision and machine learning to solve a real agricultural challenge: counting corn plants automatically and accurately from aerial drone images.

We developed an end-to-end pipeline that includes:

- Preprocessing and exploratory analysis of a real-world dataset from South America and the U.S.
- Automated generation and validation of bounding boxes.
- **Training and evaluation of YOLOv5 models** for object detection.
- **Business impact assessment** to evaluate the benefits of automation over traditional manual counting methods.

## 📊 Key Outcomes

- Achieved **0.84 precision** and **0.83 recall** in plant detection.  
- Reduced manual work by **73%**, with a projected **16% revenue increase** for Empresa X.  
- The model can support real-time, scalable deployment in crop trials and production fields.
